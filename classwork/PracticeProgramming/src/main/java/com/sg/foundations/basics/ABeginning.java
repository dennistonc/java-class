/*
Like a modern Gutenberg, the System.out.println() method takes in information
and prints it to the console terminal easily. We can print out whole books,
or even libraries, â€” this way.

Don't forget that there are other printing methods too. System.out.print()
for example, takes in information but doesn't also add in a new line character.
